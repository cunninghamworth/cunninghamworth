ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cunninghamworth
Iâ€™m interested in front-end web development.
Iâ€™m confident in my HTML and baseline CSS and Sass skills, and I'm currently working on honing my JavaScript. I'd like to expand to PHP, SQL, and some libraries & frameworks. I'm also aiming for Python (I especially enjoy automation). 
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any front-end web project, especially as it relates to some of my personal interests. I am, however open to learning and expanding into new areas.
You can reach me here on <a href="https://github.com/cunninghamworth">GitHub</a>, through my personal website (<a href="https://www.cunninghamworth.com">cunninghamworth.com</a>), or through email at <a href="mailto:cunninghamworth@gmail.com">cunninghamworth@gmail.com</a>!
